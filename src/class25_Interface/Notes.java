	 * Abstraction - process of hiding implementation details
	 * 
	 * Abstractionin JAva can be ahcieved in 2ways:
	 *     1.Abstract class
	 *     2.interface
	 *     
	 * What is the abstract class ---> is a class has a abstract key word
	 * also using abstract calss we can ahieved 0 to 100% of abstraction
	 * and abstract class the  object of the abstraction class cannot be this class cannot be instantieted
	 * for example:
	 * 1nji parent class ady bn object bolanok error berya
	 * 
	 * Abstract class defined with abstract keyword and can have implemented and unimplemented method.
	 * 
	 * non access modifiers:
	 * 1.final
	 * 2.static
	 * 3.abstract
	 * 
	 *  abstract calss can have:
	 *     constractor
	 *     instance variables 
	 *     static variables
	 *     methods 
	 *     define methods(static and instance );
	 *     undefine methods(instance);
	 *     
	 * undefine /unimplemented method/method with no bady /abstract methods----
	 * --->they cannot be PRIVATE STATIC 
	 * 
	 * cannot create object of abstract class
	 * 
	 * can abstract class instance memebers---->yesit can have 
	 * and itcan have instance methods.
	 * 
	 * we cannot override private methods
	 * 
	 * 
	 * INTERFACE  is a mechanism to achieve abstraction.
	 * INTERFACE is blueprint of the class
