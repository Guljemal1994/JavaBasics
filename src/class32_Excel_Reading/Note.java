	 * To handle file in Java(import/export dataor read/write filr) we can use 2 classes: 
	 * 1.FileInputStream - this class will help us to import the data
	 * 2.FileOutputStream - this class will help us to export the data

	 * files, xlsx files etc.....
	 * 
	 * Properties file - is file that has .properties extension and it stores data in from of key and value 
	 * 
	 * Why do we need it ???----property file mostly use to store configuration settings:
	 * We can make changes in the file without affecring source code ;
	 *                                                                               browser = Chrome
	 *                                                                               url = 
	 *                                                                               username
	 *                                                                               password= ="Admin12345" 
	 *                                                                               dataBaseUrl
	 *                                                                               dataBaseuserName
	 *                                                                               dataBasePassword
	 * driver.get(read url from propfile);
	 * driver.findElement(By.id("")).sendKeys(read password from propdile); 
	 * 
	 * To read/work with data from properties file we need Properties class:
	 *                                                                    .txt
	 *                                                                    .xls  .xlsx
	 *  To read excel we use Apache POI library
	 *  
	 *                                                                               
	 * Interface WorkBook : XSSFWorkbook class - .xlsx
