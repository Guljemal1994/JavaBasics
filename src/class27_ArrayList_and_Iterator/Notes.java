/*
 * Encapsulation - binding data and method together 
 * 
 * to achieve encapsulation:1.make data/variable private
 *                          2.make public getters/setters to access those variable
 *  
 * Collection - is a group of objects represented as single unit
 * 
 * Array is a satatic data structure that has no ready methods such as add, remove, replace, to manipulate with data 
 * 
 * 
 * Cellections are dynamic data structires that will have ready methods to manipulate with data.
 * Inside collections w store/use only OBJECT - thanks to wrappers
 * 
 * Wrappers - is not encapsulation 
 * Wrapper Classes in Java. A Wrapper class is a class whose object wraps or contains a primitive data types. 
 *  When we create an object to a wrapper class, it contains a field and in this field, we can store a primitive data types. 
 *  In other words, we can wrap a primitive value into a wrapper class object.
 * 
 * Collection is an Interface that has 3 child interfaces: list , set, Queue.
 * 
 * LIST interface: Arraylist , LinkedList , Vector.
 * WHAT TYPE OF COLLECTION is LIST - is ordered collection .
 * LIST -  is an ordred collection that allows duplicates.
