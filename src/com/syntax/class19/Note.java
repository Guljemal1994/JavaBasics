		 * Constructor - block of code similar to a method that is execute

		 * 
		 * why do we need a constructor?--> to initialize the object
		 * 
		 * 
		 *When we do not define the constructor compiler will create default 
		 *non argument constructor.
		 *
		 *if I want to create constructor:
		 *1. no return type (not even void)
		 *2. name muat be same as a class name 
		 *
		 *
		 *Constructor types :
		 *1.non argument 
		 *2.parameterized 
		 *
		 *we cannot have a same name as a below

		 *public---> means is our access modifier public gives to visibility for all class

		 *static ---> is non access modifier and sataic is makes easily for access it
		 *
		 *void ----> is return type

		 *main--> just name of our method
