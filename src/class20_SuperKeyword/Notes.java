	/*
	 * OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING (OOP) is a programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction, 
	 * encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. 
	 * It allows users to create the objects that they want and then, 
	 * create methods to handle those objects.
	 * 
	 * Class 20 
	 * 
	 * 4 main concepts of OOPs:
	 * 
	 *     1. Inheritance - process when child class /sub class/derived class inherits
	 *     all properties an behavior from a parent/super/bas class
	 *     
	 *     why??
	 *     eleminate code redundacy
	 *     improv code reusability
	 *     
	 *     how??
	 *     by using extends keywords
	 *     
	 *     what type of inheritance?
	 *     single---> 1 parent-1 child
	 *     hierchial---> 1 parent - multiple children 
	 *     multilevel ---> grandparent - parent- child
	 *     
	 *     Whis is multiple inheritance?? 
	 *     wen child class have more than 1 parent 
	 *      it is not supported though java clsses
	 *      
	 *      Who is the parent of all java classes ??
	 *      1.OBJECT classes
	 *      
	 *       Scrum team:
	 *      product owner ;
	 *      scrumMaster;
	 *      dev team;
	 *      developer ;
	 *      tester;
	 *      BussninessAnalyst;
	 *       
	 *       
	 *       Inheritice key points:
	 *       1. private members are not inherited
	 *       2. default member of super class not available if child class belongs to different package
	 *       2. protected members accessible indifferent throigh inheritance
	 *     
	 *      In Constructor inherited?
	 *     No!
	 *     
	 *     
	 *     this keyword --> used to access cuuerent 
	 *     objects/ instance members or to make a call using this() of 
	 *     current class constructor
	 *     
	 *     super keyword--> used to refer to IMMEDIATE parent class 
	 *     instance member orsuper() to call parent classs constructor
	 *     
	 *     Super is used with: 
	 *     variables 
	 *     methods 
	 *     constructor
	 *     
	 *     
	 *     Super with Constructor:
	 *     when we do not add super()---> inside child class Compiler makes call
	 *     parent class constructor using super():
	 *     
	 *     why do we want to use super()?
	 *     we ant to execute parameterized constructor of
	 *     parent class to initialize perent class variable
	 *     
	 *     
	 *     
	 *
