	 * final keyword ---> non access modifier that indentifies somthing completed and cannot be modified
	 * 
	 * final can be used:
	 *    1.variable--> final variables have constant value that cannot be changed during the program! final variables must 
	 *    be initialize 
	 *    
	 *    2.methods--> final method cannot be override 
	 *    
	 *    3. classes-->final classes cannot have subclasses 
	 *    
	 *  4 MAIN OOPS concepts in Java 
	 *          
	 *     1. Inheritance - process when child class inherits all proparties and bihavior from the parent 
	 *         3 type   ----->  of inheratance :single, hierarcail, multilevel
	 *               
	 *    2. polimaorphism - proceess when object can perform action in different way.
	 *       type of plomorphism:
	 *       runtime /dynamic/ late binding through method overrideing
	 *       compile time/static /early binding achieved through method overloading
	 *       
	 *     3. Abstraction - a process of hiding the implementation dateils and showing only functionality to the user.
	 *     Process of hiding complexity from the users and show them only the relevsnt information
	 *     
	 * To implement abstractions in programming(Java) we use :
	 *      1. abstract class is a class that has abstract keyword and defined and undefined methods.
	 *  
	 *      2.Interface - 
	 *      
	 *      
	 *      
	 *      
	 * to define method without any implementations we use abstract keyword
	 *      
	 * abstract is a nan access modifier that identifies somthing is INCOMPLETED . 
	 * abstract keyword can be used with methods and classes
	 *       
	 *       
	 *       
    //can abstract method be static? No
	//public abstract static void m1();

	//public abstract final void m2();
	
	//can abstract method be private? NO
	//private abstract void m3();
