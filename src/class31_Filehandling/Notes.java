	 * Map - is interface -->is key and value set --> is collection of entry objects
	 * 
	 * Entry Object = key+value
	 * 
	 * Map cannot have duplicate key object.
	 * 
	 * We have 4 types of map:
	 * 
	 * 1.HAshMap - no insertion order---> is allows at least 1 null key and multiple
	 * null
	 * 
	 * 2.LinkedHashMAp - it is gonna preseve order.
	 * 
	 * 3.TreeMap - gonna is our objects and it is gonna store them keys like
	 * alphabet
	 *
	 * 4.HashTable - does not a;;ow any null keys or null values
	 * 
	 * Both HashMap & HashTable - Does not preserve the order HashMap vs HashTable
	 * 
	 * HashMap = is nonsyncronized, not thread safe
	 * 
	 * Hashtable = is syncronized, it is thread safe
	 * 
	 * Arraylist vs Vector
	 * 
	 * Arraylist - is nonsyncronized, not thread safe
	 * 
	 * Vector - is syncronized, it is thread safe
	 * 
	 * MAp<k,V> List<Map<K,V>> Map<Map<K,V>,Map<K,V>>
