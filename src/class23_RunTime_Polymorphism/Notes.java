	/*
	 * MethodOverloading---> having same method name within same class
	 * 
	 * Method Overriding ---> having same method name within Super and Subclass
	 * 
	 * In Overload method sibnature is DIFFERENT 1.number of parameter,
	 *                                           2.type od parameters 
	 *                                           
	 *  in Overriding method signature is SMAE:1.Inheratence is Must
	 *                                         2.Return type MUST be same
	 *                                         3.Access modifiers cannot be decreased, can stay same or can
	 *                                         be increased in child class
	 *  
	 *  
	 * Java supports 2 types of polomorphism 
	 *       1. Compile Time/static binding /early binding-->achieved through method overloading
	 *       2.RUNTIME --> dynamic binding/late binding-->achieved through method overriding                                        
	 *      
	 * When two static methods with same name available in parent and child class------> we are not 
	 * overriding we are achieving methodhiding     
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Can we override static ? no                         Can we overload static?? Yeees
	 * Can ve override private? Nooooo                     Can we OverLoad private ?  Yeeeeeees
	 *  
	 * -*-*-*-*-*--************************************-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-**-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-**-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-**
	 * 
	 * final keyword ---> means somthing is completed and cannot be modified.
	 * 
	 *  final can be used with: variable, method , class 
	 *  
	 *  final is non access modifier.(static , abstract);
	 *  
	 *  Synatx FOR VARIABLES
	 *  
	 *  access modifier non access modifier dataTypes name;
	 *  
	 *  
	 *  SYNTAX FOR METHODS
	 *   
	 *  access mofifier non access ReturnType name();
