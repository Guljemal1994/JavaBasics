	 * Main OOPs : 1.Inheritance 2.Polymorphism 3.Abstraction
	 * 4.Encapsulation-->process of wrapping code and data in single unit.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Encapsulation in Java is mechanism of wrapping the data (variables ) and code
	 * acting on the data (methods) togeter as a single unit. In encapsulation, the
	 * variable of a class will be hidden from other classes , and can be accessed
	 * only through the methods of thair current class
	 *
	 * Encapsulation is a data hiding.
	 * 
	 * To achive encapsulation : 1.make variables /fields private 2.make public
	 * getters and setters toaccess those variables
	 * 
	 * why do we need encapsulation??---> for a security
	 * 
	 *
	 * USING GETTERS points ----> getters can read only access. only can access
	 * variables we cannot modifier the getters we cannot set spesific values only
	 * we can simply access them
	 *
	 *
	 * USING SETTERS points--->writing access. whenever we gonna past using that
	 * value we gonna init the variables using setters we providing users the write
	 * access.
	 * 
	 *
	 * to multiple value we use arrays disadvantage of the array: 1. Array are fized
	 * in size 2.Array do nat have ready method to manipulate
	 * data(remove,replace,add,etc)
	 * 
	 * To ovvercome Limitations of array Collections cencept was introduced
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Colloections will be dynamic in size Collectins will have ready methods to
	 * manipulate with data Inside Collection we can store/use only OBJECT
	 * 
	 * What is the difference array and ArrayList???????
	 * 1.Array list is dynamical size we can add anything any time and we can remove anytime 
	 * 2.Array is static data stractr
