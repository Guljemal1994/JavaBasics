 * Main OOPs :
 *    1.Inheritance
 *    2.Polymorphism
 *    3.Abstraction
 *    4.Encapsulation-->process of wrapping code and data in single unit.
 *    
 *    
 *Encapsulation in Java is mechanism of wrapping the data (variables ) and code acting on the data (methods) togeter as a single unit.
 *In encapsulation, the variable of a class will be hidden from other classes , 
 *and can be accessed only through the methods of thair current class
 *
 * Encapsulation is a data hiding.
 * 
 * To achive encapsulation :
 *   1.make variables /fields private
 *   2.make public getters and setters toaccess those variables 
 *   
 *  why do we need encapsulation??---> for a security
 *  
 *
 *       using getters points ----> getters can read only access. only can access variables
 *                   we cannot modifier the getters 
 *                   we cannot set spesific values
 *                  only we can simply access them 
 *
 *
 *                                                                      USING SETTERS points--->writing access. 
 *                                                                        whenever we gonna past using that value we gonna init the variables 
 *                                                                        using setters we providing users the write access.
 *
